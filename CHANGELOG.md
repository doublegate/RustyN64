# Changelog

All notable changes to RustyN64 are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial workspace scaffold (cycle-accurate emulator architecture, ported from RustyNES).
- Always-on egui shell (menu bar + status bar + stub debugger window) wired to the
  `winit + wgpu + cpal + egui` frontend, presenting a cleared/test-pattern frame at the
  N64 VI dimensions with the N64 controller input map (digital + analog stick).
- Release automation: a `v*` tag now publishes a GitHub Release with per-target archives
  (Linux x86_64, macOS aarch64, Windows x86_64) containing the `rustyn64` binary, both
  licences, `NOTICE`, `README`, and `CHANGELOG`, plus a `SHA256SUMS` manifest. The tag is
  checked against the workspace version before anything is published.
- Documentation site: pushes to `main` publish the rustdoc API reference to GitHub Pages
  under `/api/`, with `/` reserved for the wasm demo that lands in Phase 6.
- `scripts/mirror_n64brew_wiki.py` builds a gitignored offline mirror of the N64brew Wiki
  at `n64brew_wiki/` (see its `README.md`).

### Changed

- Modernized the frontend against egui 0.34 / wgpu 29 / cpal 0.18 (`Panel::*::show_inside`,
  `MenuBar::new().ui`, `ui.close`, `Context::run_ui`, `CurrentSurfaceTexture`, the
  `experimental_features` / `multiview_mask` / `immediate_size` descriptor fields).
- Aligned the `to-dos/` phase overviews + ROADMAP to the N64 phase set (RSP LLE, RDP LLE+VI,
  AI audio, cart boot + saves, frontend integration, accuracy breadth).
- Filled out `CONTRIBUTING.md` (Rust-only) and fixed the markdownlint pre-commit hook to
  pass `--config .markdownlint.json`.

### Fixed

- CI, release, and Pages jobs now install the Linux system headers the frontend needs
  (`libasound2-dev`, `libudev-dev`, `libxkbcommon-dev`, `libwayland-dev`). `cpal` pulls
  `alsa-sys` and `gilrs` pulls `libudev-sys`, whose build scripts call `pkg-config`; those
  headers are absent from the GitHub runner images, so every Linux job that compiled the
  workspace would have failed in a build script.
- `release.yml` pins the toolchain to 1.96 instead of `@stable`. `rust-toolchain.toml`
  takes precedence over the action's default, so the previous config installed one
  toolchain and built with another.
