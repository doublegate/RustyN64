//! The VR4300's five-stage pipeline (ADR 0007).
//!
//! `IC` → `RF` → `EX` → `DC` → `WB` (VR4300 User's Manual §4.1, Figure 4-1):
//! Instruction Cache fetch, Register Fetch, Execution, Data Cache fetch, Write
//! Back. In-order, single-issue, with one architectural delay slot. At least 5
//! `PCycle`s are required to execute an instruction, and up to five are in flight
//! at once when the pipe flows.
//!
//! # Latches, not stages
//!
//! Five stages have four boundaries, and the state lives on the **boundaries**.
//! [`Latch`] is what travels with an instruction as it advances.
//!
//! `in_delay_slot` riding in the latch rather than in a global CPU flag is
//! load-bearing: a multi-cycle stall between a branch and its delay slot
//! desynchronises a global flag, and that is the classic bug in this area. With
//! the flag attached to the instruction, `Cause.BD` and `EPC` come out right for
//! free. `delay_slot_flag_survives_a_multi_cycle_stall` pins it.
//!
//! # Reverse step order is the latching
//!
//! [`Pipeline::advance`] runs **WB → DC → EX → RF → IC**. Each stage reads its
//! input latch and writes its output latch, so running downstream-first means a
//! stage's input still holds the *previous* cycle's value when it is read. No
//! value can therefore propagate two stages in one cycle, and **no double
//! buffering is needed** — the reverse order *is* the latching.
//!
//! This is a load-bearing invariant, not a style choice. Reversing it silently
//! makes the pipeline one-cycle-too-fast; `a_value_advances_exactly_one_stage_per_cycle`
//! is the guard.
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! **Structure only.** The stages move latches and account for time; they do not
//! decode or execute yet (T-11-002 onward). What is real here is the shape, the
//! stall/interlock mechanism, the delay-slot carriage, and the interrupt gate —
//! the parts that cannot be retrofitted later without rewriting every consumer.
